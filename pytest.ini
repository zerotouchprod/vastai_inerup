# Markers for different test types
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
    integration: Integration tests (require test video, slower)
    slow: Slow tests (ML processing, requires GPU)

# Usage examples:
# pytest -m unit              # Run only unit tests
# pytest -m integration       # Run only integration tests
# pytest -m "not slow"        # Skip slow tests (ML)
# pytest tests/unit/          # Run all unit tests
# pytest tests/integration/   # Run all integration tests
