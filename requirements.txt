# Optional Python requirements for advanced pipelines (Real-ESRGAN / RIFE) -- leave empty for ffmpeg-only
# Example if you want PyTorch-based RIFE/Real-ESRGAN:
# torch==2.0.1+cu117
# torchvision

# Utilities used by dev scripts
requests>=2.32.0
boto3>=1.28.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
PyYAML>=6.0  # For config.yaml support

# Note: 'importlib' is part of the Python standard library and does not need to be
# installed via pip; it is intentionally not listed as a pip requirement.
# If you need backport features on older Pythons, consider 'importlib-metadata'.
